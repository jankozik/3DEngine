# 3DEngine
Simple 3D rendering engine entirely written in VB.NET

Main features:
- Objects are provided by defining their vertices and an included Delaunay algorithm performs the necessary triangulations to extract the object's daces
- Multiple rendering modes, including ZBuffering (transparency is not working in ZBuffering mode)
- Multiple objects per scene
- Fast GDI+ drawing
- Save scene to GIF (animation is not currently working)
